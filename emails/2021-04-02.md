We are reaching out to you today to collect some information on your use of Censored Planet data, and get feedback on where we should be focusing our resources.

Over the next couple of weeks, we will be releasing some information on the exciting updates we've been working on with Censored Planet, starting with a post on our new and improved Satellite (DNS) measurements! We hope these resources will be helpful for you in accessing and using Censored Planet data. 

Thank you,
